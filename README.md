This is a higher-level repository that links our other projects. You'll notice it's like home-rolled submodules (without commit references).  
Github won't include submodules in web downloads, and we have a lot of users who end up clicking download zip.

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you run into issues, please see our [common issues](#common-issues).

1. Download and extract this repo somewhere on your computer.
2. Install our [dependencies](#dependencies).
3. Open the folder you downloaded: **Run the start script and follow the on-screen prompts.** You may disregard any severity warnings you see.

Once your setup process has completed, wait for it to tell you the world has started before trying to play at: http://localhost/rs2.cgi

You can press `ctrl + c` to cancel/quit out of a terminal process.

## Workflow
